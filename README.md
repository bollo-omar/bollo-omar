üìå Industry Focus ‚Äî Custom Solutions

### Meditech (Healthcare)
- Built HIPAA-aware multi-tenant outpatient clinic platforms: appointments, billing, secure medical record management, audit logging, and role-based access for doctors, admins, and patients.  
- Security & compliance: encryption at rest and in transit, audit trails, least-privilege access, vulnerability scanning.  
- Stack patterns: PostgreSQL for transactional data, MongoDB for flexible clinical documents, Redis for session/caching and real-time pub/sub (telehealth notifications, presence).  
- Integrations: Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email, payment gateways for billing.

### Edutech
- Built LMS and real-time classroom experiences with progress tracking, content delivery, and offline-first mobile support.  
- Real-time features: live class notifications, presence, and chat using Redis pub/sub and WebSockets.  
- Data & UX: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for course content and metadata, React/Angular frontends with responsive UI, Flutter and React Native mobile apps for learners.  
- Growth & analytics: event pipelines with Kafka/RabbitMQ and light-weight analytics for engagement tracking.

### Finance
- Implemented secure payment flows, reconciliation pipelines, and audit-friendly transaction logs that meet regulatory needs.  
- Architecture: strong typing and performance with Java (Quarkus/Spring Boot), Node.js for lightweight services, PostgreSQL for financial records, Redis for caching hot reads and rate-limiting.  
- Security: PCI-aware integrations, encrypted secrets, immutable audit trails, and rigorous end-to-end testing for transaction integrity.

### Enterprise SaaS
- Multi-tenant design patterns (schema-per-tenant or shared schema with tenant isolation), RBAC, tenant onboarding, metering, and billing.  
- Observability: structured logs, metrics, distributed tracing, and health checks.  
- Performance patterns: Redis for caching and rate limiting, CDNs for static assets, containerized deployments with Docker and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
